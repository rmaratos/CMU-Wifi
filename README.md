CMU Wifi
==============
Wifi Strength Visualizer for Fall 2013 15-112 Term Project.

This project depends on wxpython which can be downloaded from:
http://www.wxpython.org/download.php

This application only works on macs as it utilizes a built in wifi
command line tool.

It is strongly recommended to ensure that the data and media folders are
included in the directory to properly run the application.  It can be run
without these but the user experience will be minimal.

The application requires 3 python files: cmuwifi.py, cmu.py, and wifi.py
To run the application, simply run the 'cmuwifi.py' file.
